# rpm-get

`dnf`/`zypper`-like functionality for .RPMs published in 3rd party repositories or via direct download. It works on Fedora, openSUSE (Leap and Tumbleweed), RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux), and other related distributions.

This project is inspired by **_wimpysworld_**'s [deb-get](https://github.com/wimpysworld/deb-get) by

WARNING! This project is not ready for use!

## To-do

1. (Optional) Try transitioning this project from BASH to Ruby.
2. Rename the binaries from deb-get to rpm-get.
3. Start adding support for RPMs that do not get auto-updates. (e.g. PeaZip, Valentina Studio, etc...)
