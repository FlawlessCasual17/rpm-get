# rpm-get

WARNING! This project is not ready for use!

`dnf`/`zypper`-like functionality for .RPMs published in 3rd party repositories or via direct download. It works on Fedora, RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux), and other related distributions.

This project is inspired by [deb-get](https://github.com/wimpysworld/deb-get) by **_wimpysworld_**.

## TODO

- [ ] Add packages that don't have built-in auto updates.
- [ ] Add support for Zypper repos (openSUSE (Leap and Tumbleweed)).
