# rpm-get

WARNING! This project is not ready for use!

## To-do

1. Rename the binaries from Deb-get to RPM-get.
2. Start adding support for RPMs that do not get auto-updates. (e.g. PeaZip, Valentina Studio, etc...)
3. (Optional) Try transitioning this project to a new programming language that isn't bash.
