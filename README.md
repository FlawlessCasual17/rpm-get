# rpm-get

rpm-get functionality for .debs published in 3rd party repositories or via direct download. It works on Fedora, openSUSE (Leap and Tumbleweed), RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux), and other related distributions.

WARNING! This project is not ready for use!

## To-do

1. Rename the binaries from deb-get to rpm-get.
2. Start adding support for RPMs that do not get auto-updates. (e.g. PeaZip, Valentina Studio, etc...)
3. (Optional) Try transitioning this project to a new programming language that isn't bash.
